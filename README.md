Welcome to the repository of Kumi, an open source Taiko no Tatsujin recreation. This repository contains the very game itself, and is the main repository for the project. Everything surrounding (including but not limited to the game's backend and website) and it all can be found over on our [organization](https://github.com/kikuyodev).
# State
This project is currently in an eternally very early stage of development, and is not ready for production use. However, we are actively working on making it ready for players, and as such; everything in this repository is under active and constant development. Nothing is final, and everything is subject to change if necessary. This project is hopefully going to be ready for players in the near future, but until then, we'll be working on it as much as we can.

## Requirements
* .NET Core 6.0, or higher;
* An IDE of your choice, such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).

### Setup

Everything is pretty straightforward, and should be easy to set up.
